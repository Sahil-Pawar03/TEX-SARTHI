elif 'embroidery' in notes:
    complexity = 'complex'
    estimated_hours *= 1.5
else:
    complexity = 'standard'
    estimated_hours = 2-4

```python
if fabric in ['silk', 'wool']:
    tax_rate = 0.12  # Premium materials
elif fabric in ['cotton', 'linen']:
    tax_rate = 0.05  # Basic materials
else:
    tax_rate = 0.18  # Services and synthetic
```

### Cost Distribution
```python
if complexity == 'premium':
    material_ratio = 0.7  # 70% material
    labor_ratio = 0.3     # 30% labor
else:
